# sys-screenuploader

Homebrew Nintendo Switch NSP sysmodule for automatic upload of screen captures to remote server

Set host and port of running server part in `/config/sys-screenuploader/config.ini`

### Credits
This is my first nx homebrew app, a [template project](https://github.com/vbe0201/libnx-template/) by vbe0201 was used (and extended to support sysmodule building).

Initial sysmodule code was taken from SunTheCourier's  [SwitchPresence-Rewritten](https://github.com/SunTheCourier/SwitchPresence-Rewritten).
