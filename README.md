### Credits

This is my first nx homebrew app, a [template project](https://github.com/vbe0201/libnx-template/) by vbe0201 was used (and extended to support sysmodule building).

Initial sysmodule code was taken from SunTheCourier's  [SwitchPresence-Rewritten](https://github.com/SunTheCourier/SwitchPresence-Rewritten).
